A production-oriented Agent Skill for designing, auditing, improving, and redesigning dashboards, admin panels, CRM, analytics, and operational product interfaces.

It supports existing-product audits, evidence-driven UX improvement, visual regression, responsive UI, Persian RTL / English LTR, Light/Dark themes, reusable design systems, runtime design governance, personalization, Data Trust UX, accessibility, and performance.

## Quick start

### OpenAI Codex

```text
Use $skill-installer to install this skill from:
https://github.com/pooyahayati/production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill/tree/main/skills/production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill
```

Then:

```text
Use $production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill to audit and improve this dashboard.
```

### Claude.ai / Claude Desktop

Download the Claude-ready ZIP from the latest Release, then upload it from **Customize → Skills** and enable it.

### Claude Code

Extract the Claude-ready ZIP into:

```text
~/.claude/skills/
```

or project-local:

```text
<project>/.claude/skills/
```

Then invoke:

```text
/production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill
```

## What the Skill covers

- new dashboard/product UI design
- existing-product UI/UX audit and improvement
- evidence/confidence-based findings instead of taste-only critique
- representative before/after visual-regression evidence
- tables, forms, filters, charts, search, bulk actions, and long-running jobs
- real-time operational dashboards and stale/disconnected states
- domain-aware reasoning for CRM, support, ERP, finance, operations, security, and similar products
- Persian RTL, English LTR, bilingual typography/localization
- responsive/mobile product behavior
- Light/Dark themes, branding, logo treatment, local fonts
- accessibility and frontend performance
- reusable semantic design tokens and component contracts
- safe Owner UI/UX Control Center when runtime customization is justified
- user preferences, Saved Views, role-aware UX, and preference reconciliation
- Data Trust UX: freshness, timezone, filter scope, metric definitions, partial/stale data
- working-tree, permissions, business-logic, and regression safety

## Existing product workflow

```text
Baseline
→ Audit
→ Prioritize
→ Fix
→ Validate
→ Compare
→ Refine
```

The Skill preserves functional contracts and user-authored changes unless changes are explicitly authorized.

For broad visual changes it records actual visual QA coverage and, when screenshot/browser tooling is available, uses a representative baseline and before/after comparison.

## Runtime design governance

The optional configuration hierarchy is:

```text
Locked Product Constraints
        ↓
Design System Defaults
        ↓
Published Owner Config
        ↓
User Preferences
```

Owner runtime settings use typed/allowlisted configuration and should support, where appropriate:

```text
Draft → Preview → Validate → Publish → Version History / Rollback
```

Arbitrary CSS, JavaScript, HTML, permissions, authentication, security controls, and business logic are not treated as appearance settings.

## Updating

For a Codex installation made with `$skill-installer`:

```text
Update $production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill to the latest version from:
https://github.com/pooyahayati/production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill/tree/main/skills/production-dashboard-ui-ux-skill

Remove the currently installed copy if necessary, then reinstall it with $skill-installer.
```

The installer does not overwrite an existing destination. If the updated Skill is not detected immediately, restart Codex or start a new session.

For Claude.ai / Claude Desktop, replace the uploaded Skill with the ZIP from the newest Release.

For Claude Code, replace the installed Skill folder with the folder from the newest Claude-ready ZIP.

## Behavioral evals

Version 1.4 includes executable eval preparation and result-validation tooling plus reusable fixture projects.

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_eval_fixtures.py
python3 scripts/prepare_eval_run.py existing-safe-improvement --output /tmp/uiux-eval
python3 scripts/validate_eval_result.py eval-result.json --require-all
```

Fixtures cover:

- existing dashboard safety/changeability
- Owner runtime configuration
- Persian RTL table behavior
- analytics/Data Trust UX
- real-time operations

The harness makes behavioral testing repeatable, but it does not claim to test a model unless the prepared case is actually run in Codex/Claude and the result is recorded.

## Validation

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_release.py
python3 scripts/validate_eval_fixtures.py
python3 scripts/package_release.py --output dist
```

CI additionally runs OpenAI's current Skill validator and a real Codex `$skill-installer` smoke test.
